This repository was made for a github lab in a programming class.

I am a student at Blue Ridge Community College. My interests include:

  - python for smaller personal projects
  - java for bigger projects and my First Robotics Competition team
- filmmaking
- homelab
  - I have a raspberry pi running docker and cockpit
  - services i run include Pi-Hole, Wireguard, Immich, and a network share.
